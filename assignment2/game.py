        would intercept the ball along the desired passing path between pieces b1 and b2, then the pass is not

        path from b1 to b3, and from b3 to b2, then the player could pass from b1 to b3 to b2 as a valid move.
        Therefore, in a single turn, a player may pass their ball between pieces of the same color an unlimited
        number of times as long as the passing channels for the ball are unobstructed on each pass.
